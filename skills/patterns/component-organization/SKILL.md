# Frontend Component Organization

**This is a reference pattern.** Learn from the approach, adapt to your context — don't copy verbatim.

**Problem**: Frontend projects grow into disorganized directories where related files are hard to find and shared code has no clear home.

**Solution**: Organize by type (components, hooks, lib, types), with subdirectories for grouping related items within each type.

## Pattern

```
frontend/
├── app/                 # Framework routing (Next.js app dir, Nuxt pages, etc.)
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── page.tsx
├── components/          # All components
│   ├── ui/              # Base primitives (Button, Input, Modal)
│   ├── UserProfile.tsx
│   ├── DashboardChart.tsx
│   └── PostCard.tsx
├── hooks/               # Custom hooks
│   ├── use-auth.ts
│   ├── use-dashboard.ts
│   └── use-debounce.ts
├── lib/                 # Utilities, services, business logic
│   ├── api/             # API client, fetch helpers
│   ├── auth/            # Auth context, cookie handling
│   └── utils/           # Pure helper functions
├── queries/             # Data fetching (GraphQL queries, API calls)
├── types/               # Shared type definitions
│   ├── user.ts
│   └── post.ts
└── public/              # Static assets
```

**Key Rules**:
- **Components** live in `components/`, grouped by subdirectory when related (e.g., `ui/`)
- **Hooks** live in `hooks/`, one hook per file
- **Business logic** lives in `lib/`, organized by domain subdirectory
- **Types** shared across files live in `types/`
- **Base UI primitives** (buttons, inputs, modals) live in `components/ui/`

---

## Why This Pattern?

**Benefits**:
- **Predictable**: Know exactly where to look — all hooks in `hooks/`, all components in `components/`
- **Reusability**: Components used across multiple features are easy to find and share
- **Scalability**: Adding a new hook or component has an obvious home
- **Natural for component libraries**: Matches how shared UI kits are structured

**When to use subdirectories within a type**:
- `components/ui/` — base primitives reused everywhere
- `lib/auth/` — multiple files for one domain (context + utils + types)
- `lib/api/` — API client, interceptors, helpers

---

## When to Split

- **New file in `components/`**: When UI is reused or the parent component exceeds ~200 lines
- **New file in `hooks/`**: When stateful logic is reused or clutters a component
- **New subdirectory in `lib/`**: When a domain has 2+ related files (service + utils, context + helpers)
- **Move to `components/ui/`**: When a component is purely presentational with no business logic

## Progressive Improvement

If the developer corrects a behavior that this skill should have prevented, suggest a specific amendment to this skill to prevent the same correction in the future.
